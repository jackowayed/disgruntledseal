<h1>Rules for Extreme (9-board) Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
<ul>
<li>Extreme, or 9-board, tic-tac-toe is similar to tic-tac-toe except it doesn't end in a tie every time.</li>
<li>There are 9 boards arranged in a 3x3 grid like a big tic-tac-toe board. </li>
<li>The first move may be placed anywhere. </li>
<li>Each subsequent move must go in the board that corresponds with the the square that the last move was. </li>
<li>For example, if the first move is placed in the top-right corner of a board, the next move must go in the top-right board. </li>
<li>If a move would force someone to play in a full board, the player plays in the same board in which the last player played.</li>
<li>If that board is also full, the player may play anywhere. </li>
<li>When all squares are filled, whoever has the most tic-tac-toes wins. </li>
</ul>
